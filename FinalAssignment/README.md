# About project 
My goal for this project is to take a shoppinglist, look up the prices for these products in a list with prices from different shops and calculate the cheapest shop for the whole shopping trip.

I then want to output these calculations into easy to read graphs

# Requirements
* pandas `v3.4` or later
* matplotlib
* A textfile with productnames seperated by lineshifts in the `data/` folder (should be included)

# How-to
1. Run the `generate.py` to generate a pricelist and a json with some random shoppinglists
2. Run the `main.py` to generate images of the graphs based on the shoppinglists and pricelist

# Other
The product names included in the fooditems.txt was taken from https://www.matvaretabellen.no/
